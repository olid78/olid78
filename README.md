👋 Hello, I’m Sodiol Abdullah Olid  

I am a Software Engineering student with a strong interest in Machine Learning. I enjoy solving problems, building projects, and learning new technologies.  

I am currently learning Machine Learning, growing my company Enrokode, and exploring new ideas.  
You can find some of my previous web development work here, and I will be adding Machine Learning projects as I learn.  
I also plan to share useful ML resources along the way.
